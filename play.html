        <h3>LUKE.</h3><p> [_Draining cup._]</p><p> I reckon ye all don't like the flavor of liquor
        that hain't been stamped.</p>

        <h3>REVENUE.</h3><p> It's not so bad.</p>

        <h3>LUKE.</h3><p> The last Revenue that sit in that chair got drunk on my make.</p>

        <h3>REVENUE.</h3><p> That wouldn't be difficult.</p>

        <h3>LUKE.</h3><p> No, but it wuz awkward.</p>

        <h3>REVENUE.</h3><p> Why?</p>

        <h3>LUKE.</h3><p> I had to wait till he sobered up before I give him his ticker. I
        didn't feel like sendin' him to heaven drunk. He'd a found it awkward
        climbin' that golden ladder.</p>

        <h3>REVENUE.</h3><p> Thoughtful executioner.</p>
